/**
 * Offset-tracked scrollback buffer for a single PTY's output stream.
 *
 * This is the correctness core of the durable-terminal protocol. It keeps a
 * bounded ring of recent output chunks AND a monotonic count of every byte the
 * PTY has ever produced. That lets a reconnecting client resume from the exact
 * byte offset it last saw: {@link replayFrom} returns only the bytes after that
 * offset (no duplication), or an explicit `gap` count for bytes that have
 * already been evicted (honest, bounded loss instead of silent corruption).
 *
 * Offsets are absolute byte positions in the output stream, counted in RAW PTY
 * bytes — the buffer NEVER sanitizes. `startOffset` is the absolute position of
 * the first byte still retained in the ring; `totalBytes` is the absolute
 * position just past the last byte produced. Bytes in `[startOffset, totalBytes)`
 * are replayable; anything below `startOffset` has been evicted and can only be
 * reported as a gap. Sanitizing the replay for display (device-query stripping)
 * is a strictly higher-layer concern (see PtyHostService.getReplay) precisely so
 * that offset accounting stays in the same raw byte space the live stream uses.
 *
 * Deliberately transport-agnostic and PTY-agnostic so it can be unit-tested in
 * isolation, with no sockets and no child processes.
 *
 * Buffer ownership: {@link append} takes ownership of the chunk it is given and
 * retains that exact reference without copying — the caller must not mutate a
 * buffer after appending it (node-pty emits a fresh Buffer per data event, so
 * this holds today). {@link ReplaySlice.data} MAY alias a retained ring chunk
 * (when the replay is satisfied by a single stored chunk) OR be a freshly
 * concatenated copy (when it spans multiple chunks — see {@link sliceFrom}).
 * Either way it is read-only: consumers must treat it as immutable (only read it
 * or hand it to `ws.send`, never write into it, and never assume it stays a live
 * view of the ring). The append hot path is deliberately allocation-free; replay
 * may allocate on a multi-chunk span, but replay is the cold reconnect path.

   * Compute the bytes to replay to a client resuming from `fromOffset` (the

   *
   * - A finite, non-negative `fromOffset` behind the retained window yields a
   *   `gap` for the evicted bytes and resumes at `startOffset`.
   * - A negative/NaN `fromOffset` is treated as a fresh attach: full replay of
   *   the retained ring with no gap.
   * - An offset EQUAL to the end means the client is caught up (empty data).
   * - An offset STRICTLY beyond the end cannot occur within one continuous stream
   *   (a client cannot have received more bytes than were produced), so it is a
   *   signal that the offset was carried over from a PREVIOUS stream — a
   *   kill()+respawn under the same sessionId restarts output at 0. It is treated
   *   as a fresh attach (full replay) so the client re-syncs onto the new stream
   *   instead of clamping to the end and skipping the new process's initial output.
   *
   *   This byte-count comparison is a DEFENSIVE backstop, not the primary
   *   guarantee: it catches a stale offset LARGER than the new stream, but a new
   *   stream that has already produced >= the stale offset by the time the client
   *   reconnects would look like a normal same-stream resume. The authoritative
   *   protection lives upstream — the resume/spawn paths never kill+replace a
   *   live, attached PTY (see their hasSession guards), so a client is never
   *   handed a fresh stream under an offset it still holds. A fully-general fix (a
   *   per-spawn stream epoch echoed on reconnect) is layered on top via
   *   {@link PtyHostService.getEpoch}.
   *
   * `next` is always the raw `totalBytes` at call time, captured synchronously
   * alongside the slice so a caller that sanitizes `data` for display cannot
   * drift the two apart.
